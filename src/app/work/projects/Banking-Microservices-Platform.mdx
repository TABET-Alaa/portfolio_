## Overview

This project showcases the design and deployment of a **Banking Microservices Platform**, built using **Spring Boot**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** on **AWS Cloud**.  
Typically, banks comprise various departments ‚Äî **Accounts**, **Cards**, and **Loans** ‚Äî each managing distinct business logic and data.  
In this project, these modules were implemented as **independent microservices**, each with its own database, service registry, and API interface.

The solution follows a **cloud-native architecture**, ensuring scalability, resilience, and high availability through Kubernetes orchestration and CI/CD automation.

---

## Objectives

- Build a **modular banking system** divided into domain-specific microservices (Accounts, Cards, Loans).  
- Achieve **service independence** through Docker containerization and RESTful APIs.  
- Automate the entire **CI/CD process** using Jenkins and ArgoCD.  
- Deploy microservices on **AWS EKS** with integrated load balancing and monitoring.  
- Ensure **data persistence** using AWS RDS and MongoDB Atlas.  
- Apply **Spring Cloud** for configuration management and **Eureka** for service discovery.

---

## Key Features

- **Domain-driven architecture:** Separate microservices for Accounts, Cards, and Loans.  
- **RESTful communication:** Services interact through well-defined REST APIs.  
- **Service discovery:** Implemented using Netflix Eureka Server.  
- **Centralized gateway:** API Gateway routes requests securely to backend services.  
- **Cloud deployment:** Entire platform hosted on AWS EKS with auto-scaling.  
- **Data management:** Relational data stored in AWS RDS; transactional logs in MongoDB Atlas.  
- **Automation:** CI/CD pipeline built with Jenkins and ArgoCD.  
- **Security:** Environment-based Spring profiles and secrets managed via Kubernetes ConfigMaps.

## System Architecture

The platform is composed of several **independent microservices**:

1. **Account Service** ‚Äì manages user account data, balances, and transactions.  
2. **Card Service** ‚Äì handles debit/credit card issuance, limits, and statements.  
3. **Loan Service** ‚Äì processes loan applications, approvals, and EMI schedules.  
4. **Eureka Server** ‚Äì registers all services for discovery and communication.  
5. **API Gateway** ‚Äì acts as the unified entry point for client requests.  
6. **Docker Containers** ‚Äì each microservice packaged and versioned independently.  
7. **Kubernetes Cluster (AWS EKS)** ‚Äì manages deployments, scaling, and recovery.  
8. **Databases** ‚Äì MySQL for relational data and MongoDB Atlas for unstructured data.

## Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Push:** Developers push code to GitHub.  
2. **Build & Test:** Jenkins triggers Maven builds and runs JUnit tests.  
3. **Containerization:** Docker images are built and tagged for each service.  
4. **Image Push:** Images pushed to DockerHub for deployment.  
5. **Continuous Deployment:** ArgoCD syncs and deploys manifests to EKS cluster.  
6. **Ingress & Load Balancing:** AWS ALB routes user traffic to Kubernetes services.  
7. **Monitoring:** Kubernetes dashboard tracks pods, logs, and service health.
