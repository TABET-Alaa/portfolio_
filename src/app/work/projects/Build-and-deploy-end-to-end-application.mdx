## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Food Delivery Web Application** using **Microservices architecture**, **Spring Boot (Backend)**, and **Angular (Frontend)**.  
Each microservice ‚Äî User, Restaurant, Food Catalogue, and Order ‚Äî was developed and deployed as an independent service.  
The infrastructure was containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated using **Kubernetes** on **AWS EKS**, ensuring scalability, resilience, and cloud-native deployment.

The system also integrates **Eureka Server** for service discovery, **AWS RDS** for relational data, **MongoDB Atlas** for NoSQL data, and **Jenkins** for CI/CD automation.

---

## Objectives

- Design and implement a modular **microservices-based architecture** for a food delivery platform.  
- Automate deployment using **Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes**.  
- Host microservices on **AWS EKS** with **load balancing** via **AWS ALB**.  
- Integrate **SQL (RDS)** and **NoSQL (MongoDB Atlas)** databases.  
- Apply DevOps principles to achieve **continuous integration and deployment**.

---

## Key Features

- **Independent Microservices**: Restaurant, Food Catalogue, User, and Order services, each with its own database and REST APIs.  
- **Service Discovery**: Implemented using **Netflix Eureka Server**.  
- **Frontend Integration**: Angular SPA communicating with backend via RESTful APIs.  
- **Containerization**: Each service dockerized and managed via Kubernetes deployments.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins automates build, test, and deployment.  
- **Cloud Deployment**: Hosted on **AWS EKS** with **AWS ALB** for load balancing.  
- **Persistent Databases**: AWS RDS for SQL-based services and MongoDB Atlas for order management.  
- **Profiling**: Spring Boot profiles for dev, test, and cloud configurations.

## Architecture Overview

The application is structured into multiple layers:

1. **Frontend (Angular)** ‚Äì Interactive UI for users to browse restaurants, menus, and place orders.  
2. **Backend Microservices**:
   - **User Service** ‚Äì Manages authentication and user data (MySQL).
   - **Restaurant Service** ‚Äì Handles restaurant details (MySQL).
   - **Food Catalogue Service** ‚Äì Manages menu items and restaurant info (MySQL).
   - **Order Service** ‚Äì Stores orders using MongoDB Atlas.
3. **Eureka Server** ‚Äì Central service registry for discovery and communication.
4. **Docker & Kubernetes** ‚Äì Each microservice runs as a Docker container inside EKS pods.
5. **Databases** ‚Äì AWS RDS (Relational) and MongoDB Atlas (Document-based).
6. **Load Balancer & Ingress** ‚Äì AWS ALB + Kubernetes Ingress Controller for routing.

## Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Commit:** Developers push changes to GitHub.  
2. **Build Stage:** Jenkins triggers Maven builds for backend and Angular builds for frontend.  
3. **Testing:** JUnit tests run automatically.  
4. **Containerization:** Docker images are built for each microservice.  
5. **Push to Docker Hub:** Images are uploaded with version tags.  
6. **Deployment:** Kubernetes manifests are applied on AWS EKS using ArgoCD.  
7. **Ingress Routing:** AWS ALB routes external traffic to backend and frontend pods.
