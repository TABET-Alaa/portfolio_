## Overview

This academic project focused on the **continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)** of a web application by building an automated pipeline with **Jenkins**.  
The pipeline handled every stage from source control to containerization, ensuring faster delivery, fewer manual errors, and consistent deployment environments.

The project was carried out at **EST Casablanca** as part of the final-year studies, under the supervision of **Mr. Houssaine Ziyati**.

## Objectives

- Automate the testing, build, and deployment of a web application.  
- Integrate CI/CD tools into a coherent DevOps workflow.  
- Leverage Docker for consistent environment management.  
- Apply DevOps principles to ensure reliability, collaboration, and agility.

## Key Features

- **Source Control Integration:** Git & GitLab for version management and collaboration.  
- **Automated Build:** Maven used for project build management and dependency handling.  
- **Automated Testing:** Selenium WebDriver integrated into Jenkins pipeline for functional testing.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Jenkinsfile created to automate build ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy workflow.  
- **Containerization:** Docker used to package the application for consistent deployment.  
- **Multi-branch Pipeline:** Jenkins automatically triggers builds based on GitLab branches.  

## Tools & Technologies

| Category | Tools Used |
|-----------|------------|
| **Version Control** | Git, GitLab |
| **Build Management** | Maven |
| **Testing** | Selenium WebDriver |
| **Automation Server** | Jenkins |
| **Containerization** | Docker &amp; Docker Hub |
| **IDE** | IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code |


## Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Commit:** Developers push source code to GitLab.  
2. **Build Stage:** Jenkins triggers a Maven build.  
3. **Testing:** Selenium tests automatically run against the application.  
4. **Dockerization:** On successful tests, a Docker image is built.  
5. **Push to Docker Hub:** The image is uploaded using secure credentials.  
6. **Deployment:** Jenkins deploys the containerized app to the target environment.

## Results

- ‚úÖ **Automated end-to-end delivery pipeline** implemented  
- üß© **Reduced manual intervention** and improved reliability  
- üöÄ **Faster build and deployment cycles** through automation  
- üß† **Better collaboration** between Dev and Ops teams via shared CI/CD environment  
- üê≥ **Portable deployment** through Docker containers

## Lessons Learned

- Understanding and applying **DevOps culture (CAMS: Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing)**.  
- Mastering **Jenkins Pipelines** .  
- Integrating multiple tools seamlessly in a production-like setup.  
- Improving debugging and test automation strategies.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated how DevOps practices and CI/CD automation improve **software delivery speed, quality, and reliability**.  
Through the use of Jenkins, Docker, Maven, and GitLab, the team achieved **a complete automated pipeline**‚Äîa vital step toward real-world DevOps maturity.
