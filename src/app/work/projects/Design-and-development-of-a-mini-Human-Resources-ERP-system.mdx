## Overview

As part of my end-of-year internship (SFA) at **Digitalia**, I developed a full-stack web application using **Angular** and **Spring Boot**.  
The goal was to design and implement a digital solution to streamline internal business processes, offering a responsive, secure, and scalable architecture.

This internship provided practical experience in modern software development practices, from backend API design to frontend integration and deployment.

## Objectives

- Develop a responsive and user-friendly web application.  
- Implement a robust backend API with Spring Boot.  
- Integrate frontend and backend using RESTful services.  
- Manage authentication and role-based access control.  
- Apply clean code and agile methodologies within a real development environment.

## Key Features

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login and role-based user access.  
- **Dashboard Interface:** Real-time data visualization for admin and users.  
- **CRUD Management:** Full create, read, update, and delete functionality for entities.  
- **REST API Integration:** Connection between Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend.  
- **Responsive UI:** Adaptive design optimized for desktop and tablet views.  
- **Data Persistence:** Managed via MySQL database with JPA/Hibernate.  
- **Deployment:** Application packaged and deployed in a production-like environment.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|--------|---------------|
| **Frontend** | Angular, TypeScript, HTML5, SCSS |
| **Backend** | Spring Boot, Java, RESTful APIs |
| **Database** | MySQL, JPA/Hibernate |
| **Tools** | IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Postman |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub |
| **Build & Deployment** | Maven, Spring Boot CLI |

## Architecture

The project followed a **three-tier architecture** separating presentation, business logic, and data persistence layers for maintainability and scalability.

Frontend (Angular)  ‚Üí  REST API (Spring Boot)  ‚Üí  Database (MySQL)
```

This modular structure allowed clear responsibility separation and easier debugging while ensuring smooth communication between client and server.

## Results

- üöÄ Delivered a complete, functional full-stack web application within internship duration.  
- üîê Implemented secure authentication and data validation mechanisms.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Improved team efficiency with reusable REST APIs and modular frontend components.  
- üí° Strengthened understanding of software lifecycle management in a real-world project.

## Lessons Learned

- Building maintainable **Angular components** and **Spring Boot REST services**.  
- Applying **MVC architecture** and best development practices.  
- Collaborating in an agile environment using Git and version control workflows.  
- Gaining experience in **debugging, integration testing**, and deployment.  

## Conclusion

This internship at **Digitalia** was a formative experience that combined technical growth with practical exposure to professional software development.  
The project successfully demonstrated my ability to design, build, and deploy a full-stack web application using **Angular and Spring Boot**, applying solid principles of scalability, security, and user experience.
