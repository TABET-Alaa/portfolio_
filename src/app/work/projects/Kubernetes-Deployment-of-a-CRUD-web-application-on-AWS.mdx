## Overview

This project focuses on deploying a **CRUD web application** into a **Kubernetes cluster on AWS**, leveraging Docker for containerization and **Amazon RDS** for the database backend.  
The goal was to achieve **scalable, resilient, and self-healing deployments** while maintaining environment consistency through containerization.

The entire process — from building and testing the Docker image to deploying it on **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** — was designed as a clear **DevOps pipeline**, ensuring automation and high availability.

---

## Key Features

- **Containerization with Docker**: Built a lightweight Docker image for the CRUD app, packaging all dependencies.
- **Database Integration**: Configured Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) as the persistent backend with secure access.
- **Automated Deployment to EKS**: Deployed the container as a pod in AWS EKS using Kubernetes manifests.
- **Testing & Validation**: Local image testing on EC2 and connectivity verification between pods and RDS.
- **Monitoring & Self-Healing**: Leveraged Kubernetes health checks and auto-restart features for reliability.
- **Scalability**: Enabled horizontal pod autoscaling to handle variable traffic.

## Project Workflow

1. **Build Stage** – Created the Dockerfile and built the image locally.  
2. **Test Stage** – Ran the container on a local EC2 instance to validate CRUD operations and RDS connectivity.  
3. **Push Stage** – Uploaded the final Docker image to Docker Hub for deployment.  
4. **Deploy Stage** – Configured Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret).

## AWS Services Used

- **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** – for container orchestration  
- **EC2** – for local build and image testing  
- **RDS** – managed relational database for app persistence  
- **IAM** – for secure access control between EKS and RDS  

---

## Results

- ✅ **Consistent Deployment**: Environment-independent builds using Docker  
- ✅ **Self-Healing Infrastructure**: Automatic pod recovery on failures  
- ✅ **Improved Scalability**: Horizontal scaling based on traffic load  
- ✅ **Simplified Rollouts**: Declarative Kubernetes deployments and easy rollback support  
- ✅ **High Availability**  

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a simple CRUD application can evolve into a **cloud-native, production-ready deployment** using containerization and Kubernetes.  
By combining **Docker**, **AWS EKS**, and **Amazon RDS**, we achieved a reliable, flexible, and scalable architecture — ideal for real-world enterprise environments.
